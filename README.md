**Last Updated: 30 May 2024**

## Introduction

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") outline the rules and regulations for using the Showa Maintenance Provider app ("we," "our," "us"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, please do not use our services.

## Account Registration

### Eligibility
Users must be at least 18 years old to create an account and access our services. This ensures compliance with legal requirements and protects minors from unauthorized use of our services.

### Account Information
Users must provide accurate and complete information during registration and keep their details updated. This includes providing a valid email address, phone number, and any other required information. Inaccurate or incomplete information may result in the suspension or termination of your account.

## Services Overview

### Maintenance Monitoring
Customers can add sensors to machines to monitor vibration and temperature data. These sensors are linked to the customerâ€™s mobile app account, allowing real-time monitoring and alerts for any irregularities.

### Predictive Maintenance
Customers can request predictive maintenance based on the data collected from the sensors. This helps in preventing potential failures and prolonging the lifespan of the machinery.

### Service Provider Platform
Service providers can create maintenance companies, add maintenance engineers, and sell products in the Showa marketplace. This platform facilitates the coordination and management of maintenance services.

## Subscription and Fees

### Subscription Fee
Service providers must pay a subscription fee to use the app for providing maintenance services. This fee grants access to the service provider app and its features. The subscription model helps maintain the quality and availability of our services.

### Payment Processing
Showa (Admin) manages payments for maintenance services based on Showa's pricing policy. The cost of maintenance is calculated based on the time required to complete the service. Showa pays the service provider, but the cost of any equipment or parts needed for maintenance must be covered by the customer.

## Maintenance Service Process

### Service Requests
Customers can request maintenance services through the app. Service providers receive notifications and are responsible for carrying out the maintenance. The app facilitates scheduling and communication between customers and service providers.

### Equipment Responsibility
Showa will not take responsibility for any equipment damaged during maintenance. This responsibility lies with the service provider and the maintenance engineer. Any damages or losses must be addressed between the customer and the service provider.

### Accurate Reporting
Maintenance engineers must provide accurate and truthful information in their reports. If an engineer intentionally provides false information, both the engineer and the maintenance company may be suspended for one year. This ensures integrity and trust in our services.

### Natural Disasters
Showa will not be held responsible for any incidents occurring during maintenance work due to natural disasters. This includes earthquakes, floods, storms, and other uncontrollable events.
